| `compile-fasttext` | Compile fasttext-bloom |
| `download-data` | Download data from OSCAR dataset |
| `preprocess` | Tokenize and sentencize data |
| `train-fasttext` | Train fasttext-bloom vectors |
| `init-ngram-vectors` | Create an ngram vectors model |
| `fasttext-nn` | Demo fasttext-bloom vectors |

### ‚è≠ Workflows
